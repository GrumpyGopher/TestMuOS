# Themes
You can find all themes for muOS here. Click on a theme title to download a `.muxthm` file. Place that file on your device within `MUOS/theme`.

# Theme Library
Currently the Theme Repo is undertaking an overhaul, however you can still access themes shared by the community via the discord below.

- [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/muos). All these themes were made by members of the muOS community. Join the community today!

  
> *Some themes have matching folder artwork whilst navigating Explore Content, this is installed separately from themes. To see if a theme has these available, navigate to the specific theme's release page on the [muOS Discord server](https://discord.gg/muos).*
